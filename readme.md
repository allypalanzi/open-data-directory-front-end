## Editing the CSS

#### We're using Sass to compile our CSS so here's a quick how-to (for Mac/Linux):

Open terminal and type: `gem install sass`

`cd` into the directory where this project lives

Watch your Sass files for changes by typing `sass --watch scss:stylesheets` -- This outputs everything in your scss folder into the stylesheets folder as a compiled CSS document.

If you've never used Sass, you can write vanilla CSS into .scss files without a problem. If you're interested in learning more about Sass go [here](http://sass-lang.com/).
